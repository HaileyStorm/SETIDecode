# SETIDecode

A hacked-together project to convert a seto of ci IQ data from radio oversvatories, convert them to complex floats, then align and merge them (creating a single file, but with 8 bytes per samples instead of 2, which is for some things easier to work with). Originally intended as part of the A Sign In Space project, but not useful for that (data is clean enough to work with a single observatory file).
